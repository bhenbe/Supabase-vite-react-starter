# SUPABASE VITE REACT STARTER 
It's my first try with [Supabase](https://supabase.io) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Installation
- Clone the project and user `npm install`
- Create a supabase project
- Create a table `project` with 3 fields `id` (int8), `created_at` (timestamp) and `name` (varchar50)
- Enable [RLS](https://supabase.com/docs/learn/auth-deep-dive/auth-row-level-security)
- Create a policy for select `(role() = 'authenticated'::text)`
- Create your first user in the [Auth Tab](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth)
- Run `npm run dev` and try the app
